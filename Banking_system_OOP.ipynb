We can use inheritance, in this case, to make an Account superclass and derive the Current and Saving classes from it, but this approach means that every time we make any modification to the subclass we are overriding the superclass; which makes it hard to predict the behavior in subclasses, especially in multilevel inheritance. In addition, if an error occurs in the superclass, all subclasses will malfunction as well. That is why we are going to define the concept of an account using abstraction to define what to expect from any new account type; this will give us the ability to introduce new account types without the need to change any existing code. This will result in more robust code that is closed for modification and open for extension."

The reason we are doing that is because the 'Current Account' will not be instantiable without defining what type it is(Bronze, Silver, Gold).

In our demonstration, we are going to use a class factory to manage the instantiate for our account objects. This way we can not only get consistent results, but we can enforce some rules for instantiating some of the accounts classes, for example, having a certain income to open a Current Account with a Gold privilege or class."
